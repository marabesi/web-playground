## Workshop

This is the folder that stores the files used to host a workshop of learning web workers. The suggested approach is to have at least 2hours to follow
through the content.

- Folder loading-laggy has the application with a loading that hangs the page and makes the scenario to use web workers
- Folder workers-and-reacjs has the integration with reactjs. start-point is the scaffolding and completed-solution offers a solution

 In general, this content is better used with a theory behind it, and to support that, the following
 links are available:
